1. Install Windows first and leave room for Linux. Make sure to install Windows using UEFI. 
   It should create a ESP or EFI System Partition on /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2 (although it could be on any partition).
2. Create a Archlinux UEFI bootable USB and boot from it.
3. Disk wipe:
  # fdisk -l
  Look for 2 lines like the following
  # Disk /dev/sda: 477 GiB, 512110190592 bytes, 1000215216 sectors
  # Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes
  Calculate optimal sector size (Using physical sectors)
  # let "count = 512110190592 / 4096"
  # block=4096
  # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=$block count=$count seek=0 status=progress
4. Set the keyboard layout:
  List available layouts
  # ls /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/**/*.map.gz
  Load a layout. Default is us_en
  # loadkeys de-latin1
5. Check if you booted in UEFI:
  If the directory doesnt exist, you probably have a BIOS
  # ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
6. Connect to wifi:
  # wifi-menu
7. Set up the system clock:
  # timedatectl set-ntp true
  Check the system clock was enabled with:
  # timedatectl status
8. Partition your harddrive:
  List all partitions on your drive.
  # fdisk -l
  Pick the drive to partition
  # fdisk /dev/sda
  Create GPT partition table
  # g
  IMPORTANT: Windows will install the boot partition for you. Thus its not necessary to create another one.
  Create a LVM partition with the remaining storage space (This will contain /root, /swap, /home)
  # n
  # 5
  # Accept the Default
  # Accept the Default
  # t
  # 4
  # 31
  Print the partition table and confirm your partitions look like this:
  # p
